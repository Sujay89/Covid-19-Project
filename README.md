# Covid-19-Project
Covid-19 project is one  of the real world problem based project. This project gives you an idea about the increasing and decreasing rate of cases and you can predict as and when the lockdown will get over. In this project, I have worked with various Python libraries likes NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib. For predicting and getting overview of increasing and decreasing rate, I have used Linear Regression model. For this model, I got an efficiency of 87.89% on testing data and around 86% efficiency on training data.
